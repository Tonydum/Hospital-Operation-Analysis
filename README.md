# Hospital Operations & Patient Outcomes Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes hospital admissions, resource utilization, and patient outcomes to provide actionable insights for optimizing hospital operations. The data was visualized using Excel Power Pivot and Power BI, focusing on critical areas such as patient admissions, resource allocation, and length of stay.

## Objectives

- Analyze Resource Utilization: Understand how hospital resources, such as staff and beds, are being utilized across different wards to identify inefficiencies.
- Identify Factors Impacting Patient Outcomes: Determine the key factors that influence patient outcomes, including resource allocation, length of stay, and emergency preparedness.
- Provide Actionable Insights for Improvement: Generate insights into operational bottlenecks, underutilized resources, and potential areas for preventive measures.
- Recommend Strategies to Improve Efficiency: Develop recommendations to enhance hospital operations, reduce patient wait times, and improve overall patient care and satisfaction.

## Tools and Technologies

Excel Power Pivot: For data preparation, transformation, and initial analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is anonymized to protect patient privacy and does not contain any personally identifiable information (PII). The data includes:

Patient admissions by department and ward.
Age groups and type of admission (emergency, trauma, urgent).
Resource allocation: Number of available rooms and admissions.
Length of stay by severity of illness.

## Key Insights
Gynecology handles over 45,000 trauma and 40,000 emergency cases—consider allocating more resources to this department to manage the high volume of critical cases.

Trauma cases peak at over 25,000 in the 41-50 age group, while emergency cases are also highest in the 41-50 age group with 16,875 admissions—focus on trauma prevention and emergency preparedness for these age groups (31-60).

Patients with extreme trauma have the longest average stay at 41 days, while emergency and urgent cases average 38 days—consider process improvements to reduce stays for extreme trauma cases.

Ward S has the longest average stay at 43 days, while Ward U has the shortest at 25 days—explore applying Ward U's efficiency strategies to reduce stay durations in Ward S.

Ward R has 90,538 admissions and 3 extra rooms, while Ward P has 3,376 admissions with the most extra rooms (5). 
Ward U shows the lowest admissions with 3 extra rooms—consider reallocating resources from Ward U to busier wards like R.

## Recommendations
Optimize resource allocation: Reallocate resources from underutilized wards (e.g., Ward P) to high-demand wards (e.g., Ward R).

Focus on preventive care: Target trauma prevention programs for the 41-50 age group and improve emergency preparedness for the 51-60 age group.

Increase efficiency: Implement strategies from Ward U to reduce patient stay durations in high-demand wards like Ward S.
