# Hospital Operations & Patient Outcomes Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project analyzes hospital admissions, resource utilization, and patient outcomes to provide actionable insights for optimizing hospital operations. The data was visualized using Excel Power Pivot and Power BI, focusing on critical areas such as patient admissions, resource allocation, and length of stay.

## Key Features

Analyzed hospital admissions by age group, department, and type of admission (emergency, trauma, urgent).

Assessed resource allocation by comparing admissions and available rooms across wards.

Investigated the severity of illness and its impact on the average length of stay.

Created interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize insights and support data-driven decision-making.

## Tools and Technologies

Excel Power Pivot: For data preparation, transformation, and initial analysis.

Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizing insights.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is anonymized to protect patient privacy and does not contain any personally identifiable information (PII). The data includes:

Patient admissions by department and ward.
Age groups and type of admission (emergency, trauma, urgent).
Resource allocation: Number of available rooms and admissions.
Length of stay by severity of illness.

## Key Insights
Gynecology handles over 45,000 trauma and 40,000 emergency cases, requiring more resources to handle its critical case volume.
Trauma cases peak in the 41-50 age group, and emergency cases are most common in the 51-60 age group.
Ward S has the longest average stay at 43 days, indicating it may handle more complex cases, while Ward U has the shortest stay at 25 days.

## Recommendations
Optimize resource allocation: Reallocate resources from underutilized wards (e.g., Ward P) to high-demand wards (e.g., Ward R).
Focus on preventive care: Target trauma prevention programs for the 41-50 age group and improve emergency preparedness for the 51-60 age group.
Increase efficiency: Implement strategies from Ward U to reduce patient stay durations in high-demand wards like Ward S.

# Acknowledgements
This project was made possible by anonymized hospital data, with the aim of improving patient care and resource management.
